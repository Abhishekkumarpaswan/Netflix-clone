I have created a Netflix clone using only HTML and CSS, but it's still a work in progress. 
My ultimate aim is to develop a free and open-source streaming platform for movies, web series, and TV shows.
I want to make it accessible to everyone and welcome contributions to the project. 
Others can contribute to the project on GitHub by making pull requests.
Netflix clone will have options for user authentication, different streaming platform categories for movies and shows, and access to a wide variety of content.
Please feel free to DM me with any suggestions as I am new to this. 
Thank you! :)
